# COVID-19-Mentions
### HOW?
By fetching data from various news outlets, the program determines how many instances of COVID-19 related mentions occured from January 2020 to the current month using archived news articels. Currently, this program only accesses data from the NY Times, but I plan to support other outlets as well

### Dependencies
