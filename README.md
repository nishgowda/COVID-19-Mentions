# COVID-19-Mentions
### HOW?
By fetching data from various news outlets, the program determines how many instances of COVID-19 related mentions occured from January 2020 to the current month using archived news articels. Currently, this program only accesses data from the NY Times, The Guardian, and CNN, but I plan to support other outlets as well.

### How to Run:
- cd into directory
- python3 (python file) < text file name > < directory name > (note the this directory will be made in the directory of your python file)

### Dependencies
- requests
- json
- sys
- os
- newsapi

### TO DO:
- [ ] Access more news API's
- [ ] Increase request rate for NY Times
